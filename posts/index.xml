      <description>Suppose that a petrol station has sold 1,642,500L of petrol over the year, and counts $2,217,375 in revenues. That&amp;rsquo;s an average price of $1.35 per L of petrol.
$$ \cfrac{1,642,500}{2,217,375} = 1.35 $$
Now suppose that you are a car owner. Every day, you drive past the local petrol station and note down the advertised price. 60% of these days, the price is the typical $1.30 per L. For 10% of these days, it&amp;rsquo;s significantly cheaper at $1.</description>
