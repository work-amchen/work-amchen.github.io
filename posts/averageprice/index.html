    <h1>What is an average price?</h1>

  <p>Suppose that a petrol station has sold 1,642,500L of petrol over the year, and counts $2,217,375 in revenues. That&rsquo;s an average price of $1.35 per L of petrol.</p>
<p>$$ \cfrac{1,642,500}{2,217,375} = 1.35 $$</p>
<p>Now suppose that you are a car owner. Every day, you drive past the local petrol station and note down the advertised price. 60% of these days, the price is the typical $1.30 per L. For 10% of these days, it&rsquo;s significantly cheaper at $1.20. And on the remaining 30% of the days, petrol is at a temporary shortage, so prices are hiked to $1.40. You calculate an average price of $1.32 per L.</p>
<p>$$1.20 * 0.1 + 1.30 * 0.6 + 1.40 * 0.3 = 1.32$$</p>
<p>There are two different averages for the price of petrol, but this is no contradiction. There is a different price advertised each day, and this difference can be achieved if more petrol is being bought on the more expensive days.</p>
<p>There is a weird interaction between price, time and volume here. Here&rsquo;s another example. If a store makes no sales year-round, but then has a flurry of customers rushing through the door during the 50% off store-wide Christmas sale, what should be the average price?</p>
<h2 id="trading-price-vs-trading-volume">Trading Price vs. Trading Volume</h2>
<p>Price is only an advertising mechanism. Volume is where you find the true market value of goods. It&rsquo;s an interesting and underappreciated idea, and it has severe implications on decision making. If it didn&rsquo;t, then day-traders wouldn&rsquo;t be using these ideas.</p>
